Since 2017 I am a researcher in Machine Learning at Huawei Paris, in the Noah's Ark lab. I have been focusing on theoretical questions along telecommunication problems.

I did my PhD in *algebraic combinatorics* at LRI (Laboratoire de Recherche en Informatique, Université Paris-Saclay) under the supervision of Nicolas M. Thiéry. More precisely I studied the representation theory of monoids from a combinatorial perspective.

## Interests

My current research interests are located within the field of machine learning, in particular I am looking at
* Transfer learning
* Time-series and Structured data
* Theory behind deep learning

Here is a list of my [papers](papers.html).

## Student
