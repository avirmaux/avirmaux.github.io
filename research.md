Since 2017 I am a senior research scientist in Machine Learning at Huawei Paris, in the Noah's Ark lab. I have been focusing on theoretical questions along telecommunication problems.

I did my PhD in *algebraic combinatorics* at LRI (Laboratoire de Recherche en Informatique, Université Paris-Saclay) under the supervision of Nicolas M. Thiéry.
More precisely I studied the representation theory of monoids from a combinatorial perspective.

## Interests

My current research interests are located within the field of machine learning, in particular I am looking at
* Transfer learning
* Time-series and Structured data
* Theory behind deep learning

Here is a list of my [papers](papers.html).

## Software developement

During my PhD I was involved in the developement of [SageMath](https://www.sagemath.org/), in particular its combinatorial part.

## Student

* Pavlo Pasko (Kharkiv Polytechnic Institute) (winter 2023): internship on modelization of batteries using RC-models and application to electric cars, simulation and parameter estimation.
* [George Dasoulas](https://gdasoulas.github.io/) (co-supervised with [Michalis Vaziriannis](http://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/Labo/Michalis.Vazirgiannis/) and [Kevin Scaman](https://scaman.wordpress.com/)) (2019--2022): PhD on learning models for graphs.
