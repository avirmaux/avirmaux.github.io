Since 2017 I am a researcher in Machine Learning at Huawei Paris, in the Noah's
Ark lab.

In a previous life, I did my PhD in *algebraic combinatorics*, more precisely I
studied the representation theory of monoids.

## Interests

My current research interests are located within the field of machine learning, in particular I am looking at
* Transfer learning
* Structured data
* Theory behind deep learning

Here is a list of my [papers](papers.html).
