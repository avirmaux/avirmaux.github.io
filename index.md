I am a machine learning researcher.

From 2017 and until July 2024, I was working at *Huawei Paris* within the *Noah's Ark* [GTSParis team](https://gtsbrain-paris.github.io/)
Beforehand, I did my PhD in algebraic combinatorics with [Nicolas M. Thi√©ry](https://nicolas.thiery.name) on the representation theory of monoids.

Currently, my main interests lies in applying deep learning methods to structured data such as graphs and time-series, both in theory and in practice.
