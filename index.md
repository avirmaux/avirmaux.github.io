I am a machine learning researcher.

From 2017 and until July 2024, I was working at *Huawei Paris* within the *Noah's Ark* [GTSParis team](https://gtsbrain-paris.github.io/)

My main interest lies in applying deep learning to structured data such as graph and time-series.
Recently, I have been involved in projects related to **transfer learning**, modelling and anomaly detection in time-series.

You can contact me at aladin [dot] virmaux [at] huawei [dot] com.
